# python_for_finance
replication of code  with notes from material in the book "Python for Finance" by  Yves Hilpisch.  The first edition of this book is dated December 27, 2014.  This was the version I originally used, but a large amount of the code had to be updated since the examples in the original text use Python 2 (I had to update to Python 3, as well as update all  usage to be compatible with the most current versions of modules, libraries, etc.  However, there is now a second edition of the book, release December 31, 2018, which uses Python 3 for examples in the text.  This new edition will allow me to check the adjustments I made previously, while also providing a solid excuse for me to re-read the  book.
